This project is built using React running with Vite, providing a fast and efficient development environment for modern web applications.

It serves as the front-end of an E-commerce application, leveraging React Redux for state management and integrating API operations to handle data fetching and modifications. 

Key features include:
- Filtering and Sorting: Users can easily filter and sort products to refine their shopping experience.
- Dynamic Stock Management: The stock quantity is automatically updated with each purchase action, ensuring real-time inventory tracking.


This setup creates a responsive and interactive user experience, seamlessly connecting the front-end with backend operations.
